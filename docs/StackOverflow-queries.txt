I experimented with variations of this query: Unmerged answered self-duplicates (list of stub Qs) (https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/992019/unmerged-answered-self-duplicates-list-of-stub-qs), which returned 8626 rows returned in 4395 ms. I clicked on a few of the links in the results. Each of those questions had a highlight at the top that said, "This question already has an answer here:" or "Possible Duplicate:" with a link to another question. I guess I never noticed this highlighted block before when searching in Stack Overflow.
